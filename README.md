# **Python-Challenge**

## Background 
In this assignment, I used the concepts learned to complete two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks presented with real-world situations using CSV files (converting, reading, and cleaning), Python scripting techniques, printing to terminal, and converting to a text file. Python was used to develop a descriptive analysis of financial records and election results. 

All data for this dataset was generated by _edX Boot Camps LLC_, and is intended for educational purposes only. 

### PyBank
In this section of the challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze financial records. Using the dataset provided called [budget_data.csv], I calculated the following values: 
    * The total number of months included in the dataset 
    * The net total of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    * The changes in "Proftit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 

### PyPoll
In this section of the challenge, I was tasked with assisting a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Using the dataset provided called [election_data.csv], I created a Python script to analyze the votes and calculate each of the following values: 
    * The total number of votes cast
    * A complete list of candidates who recieved votes
    * The percentage of votes each candidate won
    * The total number of votes each candidate won 
    * The winner of the election based on popular vote
